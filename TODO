# TODO

- Drag and drop file method.
- TagToRdf takes max 3 arguments. Include output format field in forms and call method accordingly.
- In api, create models function is saving the files again. So files sent to API is saved to 2 folders
    media/api/<username>/<time> --> This contains the result files too.
    media/apifiles/<username>/<time>
- API for check license
- Implement scancode-toolkit in online tools (Maybe using something similar to aboutcode-manager to display results)
